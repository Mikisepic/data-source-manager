## 2022 July 22nd, Friday 14:00

**Agenda**
* ER Model Feedback
* Shareable contents in Groups and displaying it in ER Model?
* Why is a current way of refferencing images incorrect? Not all images are referenced.
* Organizational questions:
  * Make sure I can work alone? Should be visible in the repository as well: separate branch or whole new repo will be just fine.
  * Requirement differences when presenting solo? Everything stays the same except I have less time for presentation and demo.
  * Differences of final result between former teammates? Parts of previous result can stay there.
  * Demo presentation locally in case of VM malfunction? Localhost demo is possible but should still be compatible with VU MIF infrastructure
  * Defense date? From September 2nd the earliest if nothing unexpected happens
